In addition, many consumers prefer the tactile experience of selecting their preferred products from the shelf, which remains an advantage for brick-and-mortar stores.

The traditional retail sector continues to play an essential role in promoting and distributing ripe olives across the United States.</p><p>The offline sales segment is also bolstered by in-store promotions and discounts, which are effective in attracting customers.
